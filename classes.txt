== Classes ==

1) Hide internal structure, the less known the better. So use private data and probably accesors. 
This leads to rule number 2.

2) Prefer Data Structures instead of Objects.

3) Avoid hybrid classes, by using them you bring a lot of rigidity to your code.

4) Prefer non-static methods.

5) Classes should be small.

6) A base class should know nothing about their derivatives.

7) Classes should refer to only one thing.

8) All previous name-related rules about simplicity, typos etc.

9) The name of the class should be a noun or a noun phrase related.

10) Don't make logical dependency between the class methods. Actually don't do it at all.
